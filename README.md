# LTC webpage

It is the page made for LTC student club. 
It provides interface to search for notes that we gathered on our Google Drive.

## How does "Backend" works?
1. We have python scripts (in `assets/DBmanage/`) that interacts with data on Google Drive:
  - `getDriveTree.py`  
    It uses apiKEy and pulls info about Drive files. It generates the `autoGenerated/notesTree.yml` (at the `_data/` dir)  
  - `updateDBs.py`  
    It process `notesTree.yml` file and extracts info about
    - lecturers surnames,
    - notes names,
    - subject mames.
   After that script search names that is not in database yet and writes them in `autoGenerated/newLecturers.yml` and `autoGenerated/newSubjects.yml`.
   Notes with strange names goes into `autoGenerated/badNamedNotesAndSubjects.log`.
    - `addNewNames.py`  
      This script allows easily add new names in databases (by hand). Just run `make addNames` (from `DBmanage` dir) and follow instructions.   
3. Every day the GitHub actions runs our scripts to update databases (except `addNewNames.py`).
