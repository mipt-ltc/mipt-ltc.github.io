# LTC webpage
It is the page made for the LTC student club. It provides an interface to search for notes that we gathered on our Google Drive.

## How does "Backend" works?
- We have python scripts (in `assets/DBmanage/`) that interacts with data on Google Drive:
  1. `getDriveTree.py`  
    It uses an API key and pulls info about Drive files. It generates the `autoGenerated/notesTree.yml` (at the `_data/` dir)
  1. `updateDBs.py`
    It processes the `notesTree.yml` file and extracts info about
    - lecturers surnames,
    - notes names,
    - subject names. 
  1. After that script search names that are not in the database yet and writes them in `autoGenerated/newLecturers.yml` and `autoGenerated/newSubjects.yml`. Notes with strange names go into `autoGenerated/badNamedNotesAndSubjects.log`.
  1. `addNewNames.py`
    This script allows easily add new names in databases (by hand). Just run make addNames (from `assets/DBmanage/` dir) and follow instructions.
- Every day the GitHub actions run our scripts to update databases (except `addNewNames.py`).
